## Firmware Configuration

Configured for AnyCubic i3 Mega-S with TMC2208v3

Currently experimenting with `v2.0.X`.

Below are changes that deviate from upstream.

| Setting            | Value         | Notes                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| JUNCTION_DEVIATION | **[ON]** 0.05 | Seems to provide much sharper corners |
